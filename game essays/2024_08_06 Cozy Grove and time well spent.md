# Cozy Grove
## what is cozy and what does real time events mean for players

Animal Crossing introduced the world to a game played patiently and in real time. Flowers takes hours or even days to grow and relationships with villagers can't be brute forced, only tended to. 

This formula has since become a staple of mobile idle games as a play in your pocket type experience. It isn't intrusive, it becomes part of your routine and the player can opt in their time as much as they want. The point is the base of the experience requires little time making it easy to bring into the fold of your daily routine.

These mechanics have found a home on mobile devices because we tend to be on them daily. It's not a huge ask while on the way to work or waiting for the elevator to pick some virtual crops and put your phone away. 

The Nintendo Switch in some ways is an odd meld of the mobility and innocuousness of the mobile phone and the stronger processing power and greater time investment of a full game system. 

Cozy Grove straddles this fence awkwardly and unsuccessfully. The tasks that can only be refreshed after a real life day ends adds a drawn out playtime that feels strange for a game system I'm taking out to play games on for at least an hour. 

Cozy Grove's ideas around time and patience feel in direct conversation with Animal Crossing's legacy. In some way, Cozy Grove feels like a more type A designer trying to foist a kind of routine or habitual play on me rather than allowing me, the player to find that rhythm for myself. 

Perhaps it's unfair, as I come off the heels of Spiritfarer, a similarly constructed game around time, discovery and patience but offers the player a sandbox that they can rush through and hurry along through or take their time as one might fish on a boat for a day to catch nothing but enjoy the day.

Both Spiritfarer and Cozy Grove take the theme of death and afterlife in different ways, all about productivity and making work for the player to do. (Unrelated: am I disappointed that games set in the afterlife still ask me to complete tasks, harvest, and make products to sell? Yeah. I really am.) 

Asking time from a player is such a finicky thing. We are all thinking about replayability and engagement while we live in a world where players have endless choice of what they can do with their spare time. If it's not my game it's a backlog of at least 50 other games they could be playing. 

Playing these modern titles in conversation with Animal Crossing reminds me of the pre-internet world I was playing Animal Crossing: Wild World in on the DS. There was less multiplayer capabilities, less to do, but a lot more to discover over time. Animal Crossing then wasn't fighting for my attention the way modern games need to. The game loop I'd just play over and over is to walk around my town, maybe go fishing, maybe catch some bugs but mostly talk to my residents. I can't imagine I was playing on that DS for longer than an hour but now days it's hard to imagine those old games capturing my attention at all.

Animal Crossing was a sandbox of things that could be done. Not everything revolved around a 24 hour timer, in fact most things had to work off staggered timers that ran faster or slower than other things so the player could always find something to do. This is captured well in a modern twist with Spiritfarer. Plants grow over real time and your boat might not travel at night (in game time maybe 10 mins) but you can play a small rhythm game to make your plants grow faster. All the small timers that are visible and invisible to the player allow there to constantly be small or large things. The player might not be constantly advancing major plotlines but at least they can grow 50 potatoes while they wait for something else in the game to happen.

Cozy Grove's mistake is most if not all of the game is on a 24 hour timer. This is related to major tasks and events but also to resource harvesting. The game tries to remind you at every turn that this is intentional, that sometimes you'll need to wait multiple days to get tasks done or save items for later. Cozy Grove's resources don't respawn until a new day begins, new tasks aren't assigned until a new day begins, imps won't request new items, and non baking mail doesn't get delivered until a new day begins. This makes the game's action bottleneck around the first 10 minutes you're playing on a new day. Once most tasks that can be completed are finished, once you've done a sufficent round of harvesting, the game is practically over. Cozy Grove has nothing left for you besides fishing and bug catching. This is a decent loop for someone on the go, but leaves a player ready to play a game for at least an hour twiddling their thumbs. 

Spiritfarer's means of combatting this is allowing the player agency to grow things and harvest thing on a smaller set of timers. The player might gain nothing from spending 30 straight minutes in the foundry turning all of their ore into metal but they at least won't see that time as wasted because they got to choose what they did with the time they had to give to the game. 

In comparison, Cozy Grove allows the player to craft but that either is resolved immediately or within 5 real world minutes. The player can't independently harvest materials until the day changes so even crafting gets bottlenecked by only having a finite of resources provided daily. You can't talk to your residents in a way that is productive or interesting. It's reminescent of a classic Animal Crossing game, pre internet, before the influx of an entire "cozy" category of indie games existed. It's an interesting case study in real-time game mechanics but it's peers are learning from these design constraints from the early 2010s.
