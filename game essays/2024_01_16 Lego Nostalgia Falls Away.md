# Revisiting Lego Star Wars

What happens when the nostalgia of a classic IP falls away a couple hours in? And all you're left with is the gameplay, is it engaging? is it interesting or are you just driven by a morbid curiousity to see how things were built different and strayed from the original?

I started playing Lego Star Wars: Luke Skywalker Saga which includes chapters that were redone from the original Lego Star Wars trilogy made for the PS2 (probably). In my head I assumed the voiced characters and updated graphics were all just shiny polish on an old cash cow. But, boy was I wrong. 

Lego Star Wars adds a couple different things that changes the game in interesting ways.
1. Open World/Hub world
2. Optional Rumors side quests
3. Puzzles for hidden bricks

I've only finished a chapter so I've only got pretty early thoughts and haven't seen some features take full fruition but at this point I'll speak on these three features.

## Open World/Hub World

There's a funny limbo moment when you travel to a new planet before you actually accept your first mission. You can land on Mos Eisley and be told "Hey you gotta find R2D2" which will start your quest but before that there's a bit of a narrative lead in where the player is free to explore the space. The level design has of course learned from classic Lego games and lead the player with studs doted around the space and NPCs with intreguing rumors and side quests

## Rumors and Side Quests

To be sure, I was pretty confused when I landed on my first area and was talking to NPCs getting _rumors_ about "puzzles" while I had a main objective telling me to go elsewhere. There's something lovely that fills out the world in the way the player is trained to talk to people even if they only have flavor text. Rumors do a great job at training the player to be interested in the world hollistically, pay attention to the people in the space and their role in the environment. Sometimes they give side quests that specifically divert the player to complete an objective but the bulk of NPCs have "rumors" that can hint you to where hidden bricks can be found. I have fond (and not so fond) memories of my brother and I scouring wikis and walkthroughs trying to find hidden golden bricks that sometimes were missed cause of bad design/placement. There's something about the optional rumors that gives the player agency to solve the problem. Without the rumors hidden bricks can still usually be found by using clues in the environment but it never feels unfair because the option is there for the game to show you the way if you pay enough attention. 

## Puzzle for hidden bricks

I touched on it a bit above but there's something always so lovely about being able to accomplish a puzzle without getting a required NPC backstory or other gated action that feels less intuitive then seeing the pieces of the puzzle and seeing what happens when you put them together. So much of the discovery and surprise in Lego is enabled by this design that rewards players for paying attention and just seeing whats up. I completed so many hidden brick puzzles by just investigating an item I could pick up and seeing places on the map it could be placed and realizing it was a battery that unlocked a brick. Lego really utilizes the afforance of see a button, wanna press the button player mentality. Like, of course if I see a R2D2 interface im gonna mess with it and if a gate opens or something I'm gonna investigate!
