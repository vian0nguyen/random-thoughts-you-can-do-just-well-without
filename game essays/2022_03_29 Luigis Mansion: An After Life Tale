Ghosts can be one of the most lore
What happens when ghosts are binarily evil -- there's no space for intriuging narrative storytelling around why these ghosts are trapped, what unfinished business do they have and why are they angry?
Almost every representation of ghosts in games depict a spirit that's ANGRY. Luigi's Mansion as a series has always relied on this trope shortcut to make a game that's essentially Ghost Busters. Luigi's Mansion doesn't move away from this formula and continues on in this tradition of providing interesting ghost fights that tie into their location and occupation in the fancy hotel. Luigi's Mansion's core gameplay doesn't need to change so much as I think the narrative needs to move away from binary ridges of Good and Evil. The more interesting question to me is what are these ghost's unfinished business and why do they all relate to their role in the hotel? Questions jump out about the rights of these workers, how did they feel about their work?
