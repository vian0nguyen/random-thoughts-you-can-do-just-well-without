# Why Make Games?
## a manifesto about how interactivity transforms creation
---
I think there's a lot of times people will play games and think, this isn't _good_. No one is born knowing the best way to articulate why. That's why art critics exist. But it just takes practice. A lot of the times games I find "aren't good" are due to complex reasons it takes me at least a couple months to reflect on and talk about with others to identify. 

I think it's a normal and natural impulse to watch or consume anything and evaluate it. Taste is usually developed by experiencing the world and all people have created for it and about it.

### 1. What makes games Good (to me)
a short list would include some contradictory and paradoxical stuff
* engaging
* but sometimes holds my hand enough that i don't need to always be engaged
* make be laugh
* but not make me read a novel

This list is ultimately, unhelpful because there's definitely games I can think about that fulfill this criteria and I still probably wouldn't like. 

Put it simply, i think games that are good are best _as games_. I think there's a lot of times you can put your big budget into a game, have beautiful cut scenes, many mechanics, in-game currency, and still, at your core, not need to be a game. Sometimes it felt like the _Last of Us_ was better as a TV show because it was just such a cinematic game. But maybe it still succeeded as a game because it's tight stealth action gameplay put you inside the tension more than any movie or TV show could. 

### 2. What are games?
I used to think games were a space for empathy first and foremost. I think that's still true but I think it's interactivity makes that empathy space take the form of a question instead of a statement. 

My instinct is to create games that put the player into _my_ shoes and have them feel like me. Create rules and a system to move within that provides the feeling I have everyday as a queer poc in the world. It's a rigid balance, a dance to move through the world, to get through the day.
I think that's a valid type of game to make, games like _Gone Home_ and _What Remains of Edith Finch_ and _Depression Quest_ tell a beautiful story in a empathy space of a statement. It guides your hand along the path it built for you, no matter how heart wrenching the path might feel. In the same way a book might. These games still succeed as games though, because a story told on rails can still have a beautiful view. And these stories make use of their medium. It might be guiding your hand through, but you're still feeling your legs grow weak as you walk down the path, you can still feel doubt set into your forward movement, frustrated at how lost you've become even though you know you're moving along a path.

Lately I've been thinking about **INTERACTION**. Right? It's the whole twist in the medium. To me, I can boil that down to a question. In games you give the player a question and provide them specific tools to answer you. 
Must you? Can you be a moral person in a video game? In _Undertale_ it gives you enemies to talk to or fight and you choose how you answer.
How can you be a hero? _Breath of the Wild_ asks this as a plethora of things to do (arguably). I mean, only the true hero of legend would complete all the side quests, finish all the shrines, get all the equipment, etc etc
_The Stanley Parable_ asks this question in possibly the most expensive and intensive design ways as possible. Literally any answer is designed for and thought of. In fact, the game is full of different answers and is about?? Finding each one? (unclear)

I think there's a common belief in games that if the player Wants to do something the game should anticipate and design something around that desire. I think this belief and designing spaces of empathy are like rival twins in that way. How can you make a player feel for someone else when you're also trying to anticipate anything they may want to do?

I've never been interested in the power fantasy concept of games. I think that's a symptom of men making games for other men who have experience feeling powerful and are excited to have a medium to bend that powerful feeling to it's furthest extreme. 
Maybe _Dark Souls_ and _Bennet Fody_ games are onto something. The first half of the classic hero's journey. Overcoming the weakest point, becoming stronger, more proficient, and eventually strong enough to defeat the Big Bad. The punishing to get reach competency makes the destination sweeter. 

What about games that _just_ punish you? What if the space of empathy is just pain? Hurt? Without overcoming challenges to become better? 

I think internally, when I think about games, I stay stuck right before the overcoming and linger at the pain of not being good enough. Never being strong enough. And what question does that leave? --- How do you proceed when you can't? How do you overcome something impassable?
That's a game that can only be won by not playing. And I've given that a lot of thought too. Isn't the pinnicle of the question of interaction to make the choice to Not?

Anyway, thats not an interesting game. So I'm trying to think of makes games that are a bit different. 

Interacting is the answer to the question of a video game. The game is unresolved, unfinished until the hero succeeds at their journey, gets the gold, reaches the end, etc. 
It's in the interacting that the space of empathy can thrive. 

### So, Really, Why Play?
I feel like I look for reason to play (the conclusion of making a game). A lot of academia talks about kids, and playing make believe, creating stories. But, why do adults play? I think we probably need similar spaces to act out scenarios, try on identities, finish tasks. So why make a game to be played?
I'm less interested in the sense of accomplishment I can give a person. I've always aligned with making experiences that are reflective. 
Maybe play can be a safe space to act out scenarios but it can also be a safe space to practice difficult behaviors.
Let's say, a player often engages in negative self talk, and self hatred. Could a game put them in a space where they are playing as a character doing that to themselves? Can the game be a step removed from themselves directly that could show them ways to notice these patterns, divert them, and eventually stop them entirely? Through gaining competency at playing the game well, they also build their skills to notice negative self talk and change it. 

So maybe, the major part of play is that it's safe. There's safety in it's unreality and it's seperation from our own lives. Less scary to act out what it'd be like to have a torrid love affair and facing the consequences of your actions as opposed to wrecking your own life and real other people who might get hurt. 

### Making For Safety
There's something about making things that will be inherently safe. It makes me think of how rife the space is to be as dangerous as possible. They say that with roller coasters, the safest ones have the least safety procautions. Climbing aboard a roller coaster that has a head strap, seat belt, waist bar, etc might make you _feel_ safe but the fact the people building it only feel comfortable letting _you_ on with all that gear should be a lot more telling. 
There's this notion that safe spaces is overprotecting people from having difficult conversations but, I think it's missing the point. To make a safe space is to also signal to people, we are gonna talk about something difficult, it's gonna make you feel uncomfortable, unmoored, and confused - which is why we must establish you are safe in this space. 
When people don't feel safe, I feel they'd be less likely to take risks, do difficult things, or challenge themselves. Only when I feel safe, do I feel strong and confident to go out on a limb and try something new even if I might fail. Because I know I'll be safe even if I do.

### What Am I Making
So all this to say? What does making a "good" game look like for me? it's something that engages the medium: has the player Interact to answer a question it poses. A good game is safe and provides enough security that a player feels like they can experiment, take chances, and fail. Good games ask the player a question and also asks the player to shift their perspective to understand someone else. Maybe a good game asks the player if there can be a right and wrong when we are all just making the best choices we can given the circumstances (ie _reigns_ games). 
So I want to make something that is challenging and can feel uncomfortable for a player, who deeply wants to become better in more senses beyond skills competency. 

### Some things Im thinking about
1. balancing and respectibility: the metaphor of the literal weight on your back as you try to seem hireable or attractive in some way while also expressing yourself and who you are.
2. negativity, self hate: what does it accomplish? Why does it sometimes feel natural to do? knocking yourself down at your own expense so as not to seem too over-eager, self-absorbed?
3. comparing, contrasting: in a world where everyone is individual why is it so easy to compare yourself to others (and usually determine you are worse)
4. emotional labor as a weight and balance. when is it ok to take it on? What happens when you take on too much? who gets hurt when you take on everyones weight? And how does it feel to take everyones weight on?
5. energy and depression: why must rest be productive? can laying in bed all day feel right ever? is the only choice Self Care or Rot? why is it hard to do things for yourself and less hard to do things for other people? Why is it easier to live + be for other people than for yourself? Are you selfish for asking for help, for needing someone?
6. How do you change your mind about yourself? if you think you are Bad, Ugly, and Gross how do you change your own mind about yourself? Is the only way to think of yourself as you would a friend?
