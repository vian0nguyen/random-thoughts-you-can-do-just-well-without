## PROBLEM

There are three components to the game that at present don't interect well at all
1. It's a racing/car game
2. it's a concept album
4. tarot
5. the heartbreak narrative
6. enemy designs
7. environments -- what do they mean? why does the movement style change?

as it currently exists these textures and mechanics and themes don't seem to interact. instead they feel like a collection of interests someone might have. they are mashed together but not well integrated with each other. games can be abstract and not be so didactic to have to be obviously tied to the aesthetic they're referring to BUT they should at least speak a kind of cohesion ie. shake hands in the same way?

## SOLUTIONS

these elements dont work together. they dont even feel like theyre speaking to each other.
some thoughts on this issue

### its a racing/car game

why is this? in what way does this concept connect to heartbreak or music?
so far in the game, it doesn't really. each level features different sites of fast movement. not quite a race more just moving along a track to move in flashy ways (motorcycle gliding through a busy street, a superhero flying and running through collapsing streets, a car literal driving through a vast road, etc)
The affordance of a game that relies on this kind of aesthetic of movement is as follows:
- the sensation of running away from your problems
- dodging, avoiding issues, near-misses (of mistakes or people you might meet/paths untaken)
- there is freedom in flying, movement, escape
- the track we move on --> music track (and like music, what patterns recurr and what changes)

### its a concept album

the [lyrics](https://genius.com/Daniel-olsen-sayonara-wild-heart-lyrics) songs are about a love that's ending. the energy of the music is generally pretty high energy and pop-y. the album itself sells a cohesive narrative of a love ending and the arch of the acceptance of why things didn't work out.
In similar cross-genre adaptations songs can be a direct translation of the concept behind the songs but they don't always need to be.
* Dirty Computer Movie by Janelle Monae - just enough of a narrative paints an alternative universe of robots, androids, and an oppressive force. the visuals and music videos of each song isn't necessarily a 1:1 representation of a cohesive narrative structure but the film is tied together by the lazer focus commenting on the systems of oppression (within the fictional world and in it's analog, our world)
* Lemonade Film by Beyonce - with the addition of spoken word and interstitial film about New Orleans, this film really feels like a whole. Everything shot in the same location and, being an album about broken trust and loving someone who cheated on you, lots of the visuals from this directly speak to the song's subject matter.
The problem with a concept album video game is that it hasn't really been done before? Often times, like in this game. A concept album video game looks like a game with a soundtrack that is the album. The game attempts to work in the music directly into the stages which helps to try to combine the two things, music and game.
The issue is that this is done at a surface level, in the aesthetics alone. The texture of the level changes (the environment, the kind of vehicle, the boss) but there's no clear interactive reason why the gameplay changes and how this change is related to the new song.

EXAMPLES

| song name | evironment | boss | gameplay |
|------|------------|--------|----|
| dead of night | night in a forest | x | drive motorcycle |
| the world you knew | VR headset | X | bullet hell |
| mine | motorcycle | gemini | driving + flying |

### Enemy designs

random thought: if everytime you defeat an enemy the game says "sayonara wild heart!" and in the song the reference of a "wild heart" refers to the love lost... all the bosses are you ex's? oR alteratively all the bosses are the versions of you that couldnt make love work.. what does that mean then
