## PROBLEM

There are three components to the game that at present don't interect well at all
1. its a raceing/car game + disperate gameplay
2. it's a concept album
4. tarot
5. the heartbreak narrative
6. the choreographed fight scenes
7. enemy designs
8. environments -- what do they mean? why does the movement style change?

as it currently exists these textures and mechanics and themes don't seem to interact. instead they feel like a collection of interests someone might have. they are mashed together but not well integrated with each other. games can be abstract and not be so didactic to have to be obviously tied to the aesthetic they're referring to BUT they should at least speak a kind of cohesion ie. shake hands in the same way?

these elements dont work together. many dont even feel like theyre speaking to each other.
some thoughts on this issue

### its a racing/car game

why is this? in what way does this concept connect to heartbreak or music?
so far in the game, it doesn't really. each level features different sites of fast movement. not quite a race more just moving along a track to move in flashy ways (motorcycle gliding through a busy street, a superhero flying and running through collapsing streets, a car literal driving through a vast road, etc)
The affordance of a game that relies on this kind of aesthetic of movement is as follows:
- the sensation of running away from your problems
- dodging, avoiding issues, near-misses (of mistakes or people you might meet/paths untaken)
- there is freedom in flying, movement, escape
- the track we move on --> music track (and like music, what patterns recurr and what changes)

EDIT: in research, simogo's design philosphy is to appeal to people that didn't normally play games. hence the priority to restricting gameplay to less complexity. their goal was to mix up gameplay enough to change up the texture but not so much the player wouldn't be able to quickly pick up what to do. the KEY is simplicity
pacing was also FAST because of their pop genre choice

### its a concept album / It's a heartbreak narrative

the [lyrics](https://genius.com/Daniel-olsen-sayonara-wild-heart-lyrics) songs are about a love that's ending. the energy of the music is generally pretty high energy and pop-y. the album itself sells a cohesive narrative of a love ending and the arch of the acceptance of why things didn't work out.
In similar cross-genre adaptations songs can be a direct translation of the concept behind the songs but they don't always need to be.

The problem with a concept album video game is that it hasn't really been done before? Often times, like in this game. A concept album video game looks like a game with a soundtrack that is the album. The game attempts to work in the music directly into the stages which helps to try to combine the two things, music and game.
The issue is that this is done at a surface level, in the aesthetics alone. The texture of the level changes (the environment, the kind of vehicle, the boss) but there's no clear interactive reason why the gameplay changes and how this change is related to the new song.

EDIT: in doing some poking around at the origins of production of this game. the soundtrack was fully originally composed for the game. In prototyping they had pop music (re: chvrches, carly rae jaepson, etc to inform the vibe)

EXAMPLES

| song name | evironment | boss | gameplay |
|------|------------|--------|----|
| dead of night | night in a forest | The Howling Moons (the moon) | drive motorcycle |
| the world you knew | VR headset | The Hermit 64 (the Hermit) | bullet hell |
| mine | motorcycle | The stereo lovers (the lovers) | driving + flying |

what works well - the song (titles) directly relate to the environment

### tarot aesthetic

i'll just say it - it's pretty shallow a connection. it's entwined with the character design and other art but beyond that it's really just an aesthetic. the reason this point gets less sympathy from me is that it's a through line in some of their design choices. taking aesthetic over priority only leads to a shallow representation of a game that at it's core could be about music, love, seeing an end (future telling/tarot/divination). 

### Enemy designs

random thought: if everytime you defeat an enemy the game says "sayonara wild heart!" and in the song the reference of a "wild heart" refers to the love lost... all the bosses are you ex's? oR alteratively all the bosses are the versions of you that couldnt make love work.. what does that mean then

## PROBLEMS

there's simply too many ideas at once. it's pulling a bunch of aesthetic and design strands and not taking the time cohesively meld them all through out.

## SOLUTION

pair down the ideas. choose a couple and give those SOLID reason for existing within your interactive universe

### *ALTERATION ONE:* running from facing the truth about a love that's failed

its' only a car game, but done in different environments. all the bosses are drivers in their cars. they are still the tarot representations. their attack patterns represent different futures of the inevitable outcome.
(i dont know enough about tarot to make accurate design decisions around this aesthetic theme so here's a random example of a boss treatment!)


### *ALTERATION TWO:* It's only a fighting dance game, fight the versions of yourself that failed at love in order to accept yourself

a active narrative about fear of intimacy. literally fight your fears and all the versions of yourself that you believe fail at love in order to love yourself and accept who you are. The fighting is a tap in time rhythm game. the different bosses fight on either: different parts of the beat, on different stems (like only on the bass, only on the harmony, percussion, etc) the boss fight can be a combination of some stems
stage one: press down on the down beat
stage two: press down on down beat and hit the kick drum bit with up
stage three: press right arrow to evade violin waves
stage three: evade violin waves and press down beat
last stage: do all 4
