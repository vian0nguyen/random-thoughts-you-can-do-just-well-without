# TRUONG 

freshly graduated from a decent community college with a bio degree and animal behavioral science.

extremely energetic and enthused by learning. has been a life-long learner and kaiju fan since childhood. Truong grew up physically frail at a young age, struggling with poor immune health he didn't get to participate freely the way other kids could. He looked up to Kaiju, their strength, adaptability, and animal societies of caring. Spending much of his time getting bed rest, Truong read and drew and researched everything he could about Kaiju. He watched media and documentaries, anything he could find on any animal in the species categorization and fantasized of one day meeting one in person. As Truong grew up and got healthier and more able he dedicated his life to continuing his studies. In school he learned his dreams could become real he graduated with an associate degree and got the first job that would get him as close to the Kaiju he'd been studying all his life.

# PETER

veteran zoo keeper.

Used to be a researcher with a well-known kaiju research lab. they were testing the technology involving drifting with kaiju. he was incredibly uncomfortable with the work over time when he realized the context of his studies. He got to understand intimately what Kaiju are capable of and empathized with their plight immensely. He left that high-paying private role to work at the KCS. His only goal now is to make Kaiju lives as good as possible. Even if that means doing the mundane work of cleaning out their cages and performing perimeter checks. Now at his new role being a zookeeper he can see directly his positive impact on the animals and work directly take care of these species with the respect and dignity he believes they deserve.

* time working at zoo: 10years
* Motivations: to protect kaiju 
* feelings toward kaiju: respects their power, post humanist -- sees kaiju as an important balancing force in the world that should be preserved.

# MISS

Former military officer. Commanded the early platoons of Jaegers until reaching early (forced) retirement. She was accused of becoming too soft on the monsters as her tactics became less lethal and more capture motivated. She was slowly pushed off the force for being seen as too weak-willed. She reached out to an old friend and scientist she'd worked directly with back in her government days. She never considered a career change in zoo keeping but they needed a people person that was good at managing swaths of people all in the name of taking care of kaiju. So she took the job and never looked back.

* time working at zoo: 5 years
* motivations: keep kaiju from extinction and exploitation
* feelings toward kaiju: almost post humanist? definitely questions why humans should determine what lives and dies on the planet, whose allowed to enforce the chaos of nature?
