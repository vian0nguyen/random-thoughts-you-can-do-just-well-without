inspired by doja cat's you right libra fit

1. design all the signs in a similar style with the sign integrated on the body

2. whats the narrative progression?

a nsfw adjacent softcore narrative experience. some signs have interpersonal drama and they're trying to get together. 
similar scenarios and delimmas as in most of doja cats discography ie im horny and o generally have a moral quandry about it
maybe each scenario should have an assigned song so we stay on aesthetic
