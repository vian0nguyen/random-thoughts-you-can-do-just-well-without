the body as weird, wonky, something that can't be captured accurately
this body is weird

surgery feels like something just out of reach, maybe a little mythical

its hard to pin down the feeling i have for my body.
moments of euphoria are cut by shattering disappointment

emotionally sometimes it feels like i have to repel any kind of expectation/excitement around 

let yourself feel the sink, let yourself cry, let yourself go under

if euphoria is high, the sink is the disappointment, the fear, the struggle 


the game, 2D (for simplicity's sake, you're tight rope walking on the edge of a cliff
the fall - its a dark abyss, don't know whats down there
why on the edge of the cliff? theres things to get,
on the edge of the cliff are things that will chase you, they'll kind of get closer the more you move
you gotta use something to repel them - these are your expectations
repel them and walk the cliff until you get all the things

but eventually you must fall into the abyss, what's there is acceptance of things going wrong. etc.
