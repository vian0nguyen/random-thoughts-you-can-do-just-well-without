a zine about what the internet would look like if different people invented it
like ants?

what are their priorities? how is that reflected in their creation of a digitally created world?


I want to design and layout a beautiful book.
about what im not sure 
maybe an iteration of labyrinths and strangers and mazes and puzzles.
it'd be cool to make a digital collage and think about multi media page space
