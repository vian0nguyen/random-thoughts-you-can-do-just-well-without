a zine about what the internet would look like if different people invented it
like ants?
like? plumbers?
what are their priorities? how is that reflected in their creation of a digitally created world?


I want to design and layout a beautiful book.
about what im not sure 
maybe an iteration of labyrinths and strangers and mazes and puzzles.
it'd be cool to make a digital collage and think about multi media page space

dream: 2022/08/12
had a dream today about sunmi creating calendars sort of 
starting at a specific day and time you begin filling out the questions
and answer them in a small group of 9 other players
assumptions for how it aorks:
* youre given a unique room code
* you can share one with a friend
* everyonr is given the same question at the same time


the calendar is designed to mostly be a space for drawing and reflecting
similar to a wreck this journal but more in the vein kf a calendar
it encourages big spaces of doing what you want with it and comes with a set if rainbow markers
