inspired by west end caleb drama

lots of things on the internet especially things that can be labeled as "problematic" have a tendancy to be collapsed under a huge umbrella that lacks nuance. the whole situation of west end caleb is kinda an equal response to major me too movement "cancellations" i think of how aziz ansari's personal sexual history was compared to harvey weinstein.

game: organizing your thoughts into categorizations -> depending on the category a social media post is generated with Your Take on the situation

categories are rigged, depending on the scenario the # of categories change, maybe they can be named
the less categories the less nuanced an understanding we have

something else i saw that i think of-
sometimes i see tweets like "we should hold space for misogyny rooted in internalized transphobia"
this statement sets my brain ablaze with the visualization that currently THERE IS NOT SPACE available for anyone's personal nuances or contexts unless we otherwise state it or do the work to create space for their specific feelings.
