together lets travel through this maze of our own making
whose idea was it to go into this labyrinth
lost together in a labyrinth

p1: has grid or dot paper (the map) and pen has a d6
p2: has another paper cataloging their advenuters (the diary) and pen and a d6

together decide the maze starting point (in the center, on an the n/s/w/e edge)
p2 rolls the dice and decides the direction (n/s/w/e) except the direction you came from
p1 and 2  roll their dice and adds up their results and decides what they see
if you hit the edge of the page pick another direction and head the rest of the way
