Lost (& found) together in a labyrinth

p1: has grid or dot paper (the map) and pen has a d6
p2: has another paper cataloging their adventures (the diary) and pen and a d6

together decide the maze starting point (in the center, on a n/s/w/e edge)
p1 & p2 roll their dice and add up their results and decide what they see
p2 decides the direction (n/s/w/e) except the direction you came from
if you hit the edge of the page pick another direction and head the rest of the way

2-5 : something was lost
6-9: something/someone was met
10-12: something found

ending the maze:
any time you hit the edge of the page, 
you can choose to exit the maze.
answer the question depending on your 
final roll that got you to your exit.

2-5 : something was left behind
6-9: a view you hope youâ€™ll remember 
10-12: something was learned
