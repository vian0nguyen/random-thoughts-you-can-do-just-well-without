# Reading Books To Write Games
## Significant Zero by Walt Williams
* what if games weren't about making players feel powerful but were about challenging players to be their best selves?

## The Games We Played by Margaret K. Hofer
* Anagrams: word building games -- a scrabble edit that ria would like to play
  * Collaborative, less time intensive (no turn taking?)
* can childrens books be a foundation for storytelling/building games?
  * games spread out on the floor or table
  * choose your own/build your own adventure
    * turn taking, call and response, exquisite corpse (drawing game i cant recall the name right now)
  * dexterity game? --> assemble a scene (with a location: background, subject: character, action: items can be held? foreground layer image
  * combine: lead in "im always in for" with verb/action "hunting buffalo" and place "at a wedding"
  * reverse clue, create the story by finding the motive (person, weapon, location)
