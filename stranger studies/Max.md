There's something beautiful about new shoes. It's the new leather, the vibrant color, untouched by the dirtiest floor. Unmet by destinations unknown. Every shoe I've ever owned I'll always cherish and remember. 
The black Doc Martins and black rubber soled shoes my mom gave me for graduation. Chunky and bold like my high school career.
The red and white Vans I custom designed with my first paycheck. Unique and one of a kind.
The pale peach rainboots with turquoise hearts patterning it. One of my first shoes I got when I moved to Washington. Maybe I was scared of fitting into my new school but I knew I could never concede on a cute shoe that was exactly who I am.

Some of these shoes don't even fit on my feet anymore. But sometimes, keeping those shoes around (the tiny red air force 1s worn at the age of 5) reminds me where I've been, who I've been. At one point I was that kid, and now with the blink of an eye these shoes don't even fit some of my toes.

All the shoes that have walked in my life (haha). They all reflect who I was/am at the time.
That's all I can think about as I pack up these bags. How can I choose what parts of my life I bring with me?
