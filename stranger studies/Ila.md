Every day I wake up, I do my best to find the daytime moon. It's the moon you see as the sun's ray hits it. It's light blue in the sky on a clear day and something about it... It grounds me. I'm not the best at "enjoying nature." I think I like the idea of hiking and being outside but really, it's just the moon i love to look at. Maybe it's not really about nature so much as it's about the sky. Everything in it is so far and yet so enveloping. It's reassuring to know that no matter where I go, no matter how I change, the sky and moon and stars will still be there looking pretty much the same. They change though, but in ways that I know I'll live through.

Living through changes has been difficult lately for me. Like every step I'm terrified I'll find the ground. I've never found anything but solid ground and yet I'm terrified. Even if I can't explain why, I know the sky will always be there above me.
