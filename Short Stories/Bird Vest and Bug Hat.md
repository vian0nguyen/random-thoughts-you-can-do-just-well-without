### Adventures of Bird Vest and Bug Hat
As the sun rose, its beam hit the door just right: "Bird Vest and Bug Hat Agency". The two built their world together. Supporting each other in their endeavor to make the world a bit of a better place by solving mysteries together.

The morning was tranquil. Quieter than it ever was in the big Tree City. Bird Vest reflected fondly over the last case she worked with Bug Hat. The one where they solved missing triplicates of items from a leafy store front was the doing of three fancy fingered rolly pollies in a trench coat.

The door flew open as Bug Hat barged into the room.

"You'd never believe it, Bird Vest!"

Bird Vest jolted in her seat then relaxed on hearing Bug Hat's voice.

"What is it now? The mayor was replaced by a butterfly? We figured that out already, partner." Bird Vest shrugged, "Turns out the mayor took office a little underaged."

"No! Not that one again." Bug Hat continued, "I swear though, this town has a soft spot for caterpillars with a commanding voice." he murmured mostly for himself.

"What could be so important you had to huff in here so early in the morning then?"

Bug Hat's voice changed from panicked to singsongy, "It's youuur birthday!"

He revealed the bird seed peanut butter cake he was hiding behind his back. It had a handful of already lit tree branch candles. 

"I didn't wanna guess your age so I just grabbed some candles for flourish."

Bird Vest's eyes widened. She can't believe she forgot her birthday. She especially couldn't believe Bug Hat remembered.

"Bug Hat! This is so thoughtful." Her beak slightly full of bird seed. She couldn't resist.

We've been working together long enough. It's time I do you a kindness for all the times you've got my back.

"Well, this is definitely a start. I saved your butt again just last week!" She chirped gleefully.
