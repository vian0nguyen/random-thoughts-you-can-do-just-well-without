the pet rock inside tan

she has no name, the rock. it takes up space inside tan. it does what a rock does. It's heavy, and threatens to crush tan every day. But, strangely, every day the rock needs tan. Needs tan to continue on and take it along. The rock wants to see the world with tan but doesn't know it is a burden. tan is a willing enough host and for that the rock is happy enough. 

The rock doesnt know it's hurting tan. and what will the rock do if one day, tan can't handle the weight anymore. I don't remember the day when tan asked for the rock. the rock just appeared one day and needed to be cared for. I don't remember when tan signed up for this. But, here we are, tan and the rock have been together ever since the day we can't recall. 

Why not just let the rock go? It's much too late for that. The rock has embedded inside tan long enough now that tan's insides have grown into the rock, and around the rock. They need each other and can't be seperated. Even though the rock hurts tan. 

So, the rock won't get lighter and we can't remove it from tan. Then what can we do? We can share the weight. We can let people know about the rock, and how it's hurting tan and ask who is willing to share the burden of the rock. It's hard to ask for help when you're being crushed by a rock. And unlike normal rocks, no one else can see you be crushed by it. Most of the time, people have their rocks of varying sizes and sometimes never talk about it. They take on the burden of their rock alone and tend to their hurt alone. But talking about the rock helps us all share the weight. No one ever has to carry their rock alone if they don't want to.
